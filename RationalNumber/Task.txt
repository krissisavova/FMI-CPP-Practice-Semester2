Problem:
1. Write a program that creates a rational number, consisting of a numerator and a denominator. Use a struct.
2. Then add all necessary operations between two of them (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) 
and make sure the denominator is not equal to zero. 
3. Eventually, add a function that prints the final result(s).
