MiniProject:
--------------
This program represents something similar to databases. It allows: 
1) the user to type their name. A warm message appears. 
2) ADDING and CHANGING information about a particular doctor 
(last name, years of practice, name of hospital, and sex) by using struct;
2.1. Except the four things above, the structure contains:
---> an INPUT method;
---> a method for PRINTING the whole information about a specific doctor;
---> a method for CHANGING THE LAST NAME; 
---> a method for CHANGING THE HOSPITAL'S NAME.

The program finishes with a goodbye message.
